          <p><b>Breakup Quest</b> is a graphical text adventure game. My team and I built this in <i>48 hours</i> during the <b>Global Game Jam</b> in Edmonton, which is like a game development Hackathon. We built this using the <b>Unity3D</b> engine and us three programmers stayed organized using GitHub.<br>Our Global Game Jam page, where you can download and play the game, is linked above along with our GitHub repository.</p>
          <h4>Concept</h4>
          <p>Simply put, you are stuck in an arranged marriage, and you are trying to escape! Our team was looking to work on something funny and interesting and our artists came up with an idea for a <i>reverse dating simulator</i>, where the goal is to end a relationship, not build one.</p>
          <h4>Technology</h4>
          <p>We decided to use Unity3D as it's the engine we were most familiar with. In Unity3D, we implemented our own scripting engine in C# using JSON. JSON packets included information such as character name, position on screen, script, any choices the player would make in response to the script, and how the script branched based on player choices. We also scripted templates for graphical animations and transitions within scenes, such as characters fading in and out based on who was talking, text boxes containing scripts and character names that switched positions based on who was talking, and so on. This approach allowed us to seamlessly add and remove entire scenes from our game based on the material we had written and artwork created. I primarily worked on the graphical transitions as well as connecting them to JSON scene packets passed through.</p>
          <h4>Writing</h4>
          <p>We didn't have a writer! This meant we had to improvise. I ended up contributing quite a bit to the script and tried to make it as funny as I could. The reactions we have been getting from people who play our game has been full of laughter, so I think we did OK!</p>
          <h4>Art</h4>
          <p>All the artwork was created by the extremely talented Lisa Lindsay and Cody Schiebelbein using Photoshop. The game is naturally very graphics intensive and the artwork gives the game a fantastic feel.</p>
